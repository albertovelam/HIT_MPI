HIT, a parallel GPGPU code to simulate Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence
=======================================================================

HIT, for (Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence) can solve the
Navier-Stokes equations in a 3D periodic domain, following the
algorithm described by *Numerical Experiments in Homogeneous
Turbulence* NASA Technical Memorandum 81315 By Robert S. Rogallo.
